## GarrisonSpark.java
    - Intended to be the FileReader that turns the csv into a stream to be fed into Kafka?
    - Code obtained from "Structured Streaming Programming Guide" in Spark Documentation
    - Probably needs winutils in order to run, according to Internet

## Kafka.java
    - A rough copy of Mehrab's Hello World equivalent in Kafka
    - Turned into a consumer?

## Schema.java
    - Something that might end up being useful some point down the line, I guess. 

## dummydata.csv
    - Contains the first couple hundred lines of our dataset.
